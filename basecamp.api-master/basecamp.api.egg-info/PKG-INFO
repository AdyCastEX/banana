Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        Python wrapper for Basecamp REST API.
        
        The only Python wrapper that doesn't make you parse xml response but provides
        native Python objects as response from Basecamp API call.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Quick example on how to use it. Here we are counting all our hours logged in
        during November 2012::
        
            >>> from basecamp.api import Basecamp
            >>> bc = Basecamp('https://example.basecamphq.com/', 'my_username', 'pass')
        
            >>> me = bc.getCurrentPerson().id
        
            >>> total = 0.0
            >>> for te in bc.getEntriesReport('2012-11-01, '2012-11-30', subject_id=me):
            ...     print '%s: %0.2f' % (te.description, float(te.hours))
        
        As you see as response from 'getEntriesReport' we have got list of time entry
        objects that have 'description' and 'hours' attributes. No xml parsing.
